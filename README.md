# hello-world
my first repositry

I am an unknown creating something new. Perhaps I will be known or perhaps this is a fun endeavour and only time will differentiate the both. I have been on the moon - and contrary to expectations - moon tacos are actually better than earth tacos. 

Don't get me started on the moon burritos - they finally learnt to manipulate gravity to ensure the fillings in a burrito are layered neatly; it makes every bite better. Remember how we used to go through all that mashed potato and guac before we even found the chicken? Well, the new GRAVITY or Gastronomic Rearrangement Analyser and Vortex Implementing Time Yeeter has revolutionized things here.
